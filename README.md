# Console Template

A simple .NET 6 console application template to get you started quickly with your console application

## Includes
* Configuration via `appsettings.json`
* `SimpleInjector` for Dependency Injection
* `Serilog` for logging

# Why? 
This template exists more so for a user to get started with a console application that has the necessary structure and dependencies set up. This way a user can focus on writing code and not spend time figuring out how to wire and set up the libraries.

This template can be used to quickly test something or create a console application for a business problem. This template leans more towards the latter. 

Enjoy!
